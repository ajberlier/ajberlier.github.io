I am Adam J. Berlier and this is my AI/Robotics portfolio. The primary goal of this content is to communicate progress in AI/Robotics research and development as a way to engage in respectful scientific discussion with the general research community. The tabulated sections of this website share my current research endeavors, exciting work I have discovered in peer reviewed literature, as well as project demonstrations and tutorials for anyone interested in building on my work. Please contact me if you would like to share feedback on my work or engage in discussion about the rapidly improving AI/Robotics state-of-the-art. Let's engage in sharing deep thoughts and collaborate on building a brighter future for artificial intelligence and robotics!
